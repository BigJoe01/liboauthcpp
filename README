liboauthcpp
-----------

liboauthcpp is a pure C++ library for performing OAuth requests. It
doesn't contain any networking code -- you provide for performing HTTP
requests yourself, however you like -- instead focusing on performing
OAuth-specific functionality and providing a nice interface for it.
If you already have infrastructure for making HTTP requests and are
looking to add OAuth support, liboauthcpp is for you.

Requirements
------------

You should only need:

* CMake
* A C++ compiler for your platform (e.g. g++, Microsoft Visual C++)

Compiling
---------

The build process is simple:

cd liboauthcpp
cd build
cmake .
make            # or open Visual Studio and build the solution

If your own project uses CMake you can also include
build/CMakeLists.txt directly into your project and reference the
target "oauthcpp", a static library, in your project.

License
-------

liboauthcpp is MIT licensed. See the LICENSE file for more details.

liboauthcpp is mostly taken from libtwitcurl
(http://code.google.com/p/twitcurl/), which is similarly licensed. It
mostly serves to isolate the OAuth code from libtwitcurl's Twitter and
cURL specific code.

libtwitcurl also borrowed code from other projects:
twitcurl uses HMAC_SHA1 from http://www.codeproject.com/KB/recipes/HMACSHA1class.aspx
twitcurl uses base64 from http://www.adp-gmbh.ch/cpp/common/base64.html
